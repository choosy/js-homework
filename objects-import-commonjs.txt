This exercise will demonstrate how commonjs modules work (require), and how to import and export.

It has two variants.

1. Export with exports
2. Export with module.exports


1. Create a file called objects-import-commonjs-course1.js in which you make a Course constructor
-> so a Course function that will create Course objects. This constructor will be exported using "exports".

This Course constructor will receive as parameters: title, description, price, keywords.

Create a file called objects-import-commonjs-use-course.js in which you import the Course constructor and you make a few objects.

2. Similar to 1. create a file objects-import-commonjs-course2.js in which you copy-paste the constructor from 1., so same constructor, but export it with module.exports.

This time modify objects-import-commonjs-use-course.js to import from objects-import-commonjs-course2.js.
