Create an example function using the function declaration syntax in JS.
Create another example function using the function expression syntax.

Test manually in the console that you cannot call the function that you made with function declaration, before you declared it.
Test then also that you CAN indeed call the function that you created with the expression syntax..so you can call this above where it was declared.
