// Intermediate function inheritance

Create the same constructors, Product, Course, Tshirt from te objects-prototype-calling-the-super-constructor.js

This time, make an extend function that will be defined with two parameters Child, Parent.


So instead of these two lines like this, use that extend(Child, Parent) function to create the prototypical inheritance:

Tshirt.prototype = Object.create(Product.prototype)
Tshirt.prototype.constructor = Tshirt


Verify that it all works, with jest.
