Create a new object of type Stopwatch using the constructor method for creating objects.

The objects of type Stopwatch will have one property: duration
And three methods: reset, start, stop.

The object should work like a stopwatch:
- when you start it, it will start counting time
- if you wanna start it again it gives an error
- when you stop it it stops counting the time
- when you access the duration it gives you the time passed since the counter was started until the moment the counter was stopped
- if you start it again, and then stop it, it will add this duration of time passed to the previous duration of time passed. So if you did start at 07:54am and you stop at 07:55am (1 minute) then you start again at 8:00am and stop at 8:01am (1 more minute), and then you access duration, it will give you 2 mins
- if you press reset, the whole duration is reset to zero
