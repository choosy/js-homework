1. Write down as comment in this JS the theory around the functions being first class citizens in JS, the meaning of it.

2. Then create an example to demonstrate all three points:
- a function saved in a variable
- a function that will be passed as an argument
- a function that will be returned within another function

3. Find in the JS documentation (or in a Node libary) one or two examples of the above, and write them in this exercise.
