As we learn object oriented programming, it is useful to know what terms mean, how things are named.
Things are a bit confusing, since different sources name or refer to things a bit different, but we'll try to clarify.

What is property</
according to MDN web docs (https://developer.mozilla.org), "an object is a collection of properties and a property is an association between a key and a value"
So that's why you have property name -> that is the key
and property value -> that is the value

A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects

In Moshe's course, he insists to refer to properties as only the keys of an object that have values that are not functions.

So Mosh uses these terms:
 - all of the key/value pairs -> members of that object
 - key/value pairs in which values are not functions -> properties
 - key/value pairs in which values are functions -> methods

In MDN and other tutorials (and also the way I use) you have:
 - all of key/value pairs -> properties
 - key/value pairs in which values are not functions -> I don't know. also properties? maybe attributes??
 - key/value pairs in which values are functions -> methods


Conclusion, the simplest way to remember is like this:

#################################################### Remember this #####################################

property is the key in the object, and the property value is the value for that key
methods are properties that have as values functions
