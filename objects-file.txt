1. Imagine you need to describe a file on your harddisk as a Javascript object.
What do we know about a file?
The file name. Ex: objects-file.js
The file full path. Ex: /Users/cah/js-training/objects-file.js
The file size. in KB (KiloBytes). Ex: 200K
The file type: js

Make an object that can describe a file. Make three objects, each describing a different file

2. Make a function that iterate through the properties of ONE object and console logs the properties (keys) of that object. one property at a time

3. Modify the function at 2. to save those properties (keys) in an array and return that array

4. Make a function that iterates through the properties of ONE object and console logs each property and value.

5. Make an array with the three objects

6. Make a function that receives the array with the three file objects (or more) and returns you the file with the biggest size.
