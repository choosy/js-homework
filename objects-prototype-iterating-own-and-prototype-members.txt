Iterating Instance and Prototype Members

Create a Course constructor, like in objects-prototype-members.js with members: price, title, description

Also, like in objects-prototype-members.js add the priceToReais and toString methods to the Course.prototype.

But add another method to the Course instance (so inside the constructor), that is called makeTitle() that will return a string with the title and price of the course.

Now iterate over the own (instance only) members of the object, and add them to an array, that is called ownMembers.

Iterate over all members (own members and prototype members) and add them to a different array called allMembers.

Use the Jasmine test framework to test that ownMembers and allMembers is correct.
