Polymorphism

// https://codewithmosh.com/courses/310571/lectures/4881278

Continuing with the objects from the objects-prototype-method-overriding.js
make a test that will have the code to create an array of objects like this
[a course object, a tshirt object, another tshirt object, a product object]

Initialize all these objects inside the test, and then define the array inside the test

make another array, with the results (what comes from return) of calling the sell() method on each object in the array above.

Make sure with the test that this array is correctly constructed, and that the sell() method works for any type of object.

The moment you build the results array, that is polymorphism in action.
