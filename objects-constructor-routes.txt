We imagine that we build a javascript application server, like Express.
Since this is a server, it will run as a web server and receive HTTP requests. So this means that we will receive requests like

GET https://example.com/teachers/1

or

POST https://example.com/teachers/create


We want to make a Route constructor, that makes objects (of type Route) that will receive these requests and analyze them and split them into parts and assign these parts to properties.

So for example, you will make a route like:

let route = Route("POST https://example.com/teachers/create")

Then the Route constructor will create an object with these properties:

method -> POST
hostname -> example.com
protocol -> https

urlPath -> /teachers/create

parameters -> empty object


If you do

GET https://example.com/teachers/1

This will create a constructor with these properties

method -> GET
hostname -> example.com
protocol -> https
urlPath -> /teachers/1
parameters -> [1]

This is just an example, the Routes in Express are not exactly like this, but it gives us an idea about how we can go about it.
