* This is js for the browser.
Make an html page, in which you include the jquery js library.
Make a paragraph that says: No data.

Make a button, that when pressed, it calls a function that uses ajax in jquery to call an api and write the response to the paragraph where no data was used.

First, look for available or public APIs to use.
