This time we will use ES6 classes, to define the constructors Product, Course and Tshirt.

In this exercise, we will just define the constructors but with ES6 classes, and without using inheritance yet.

- Change Product constructor to ES6 class
- add sell, priceToReais, and toString to the Product class

- change Course constructor to ES6 class
- add in the Course class its own toString method
- add one more method, that is specific to the course, for example: getAuthor(). Make sure you modify the constructor of course to take author as well


- change Tshirt constructor to ES6 class
- add in the Tshirt constructor the toString method
- add another method called getSize()


Write Jest tests for each object
For a Product object verify in the Jest test:
- the result of the toString()
- the result of priceToReais
- the result of sell()

For Course object verify in the Jest test:
- the result of the toString()
- the result of the getAuthor()

For the Tshirt object verify in the Jest test:
- the result of the toString()
- the result of the getSize()
