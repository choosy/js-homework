Modify the constructor Person() in exercise objects-abstraction-and-private-properties.js to use getters and setters for setting firstName, lastName and age properties to Person objects.

In this exercise, the Person() constructor will not receive any arguments. Instead, the user of the object (the code part that creates and uses the object) will set properties one by one.
Also add name as a read only property.

For example

let john_doe = Person()
john_doe.firstName = '  John  ' // will be validated and stripped from spaces under the hood
john_doe.lastName = 'Doe' // will be validated and stripped from spaces under the hood
john_doe.age = 23 // will be validated under the hood

john_doe.name = 'Jonica Donica' // will throw an error since name is a read-only property

console.log(john_doe.name) // will console log 'John Doe'
