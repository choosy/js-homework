List in the comment in the beginning of the exercise which are the value types (primitives) in JS and which are the Reference Types.

1. Demonstrate how value types (primitives) are copied by value

Create an example in which a variable is declared and points to a value type.
Then a second variable is declared that points to the first variable.
Change the second variable's value, and show what happened with the value of the first variable.


2. Demonstrate how reference types are copied by reference.

Similar to Step 1, create a variable that points this time to a reference type.
Create a second variable that points to the first variable.
Change the second variable's value and show what happened with the value of the first variable.


3. Demonstrate how value types (primitives) are copied by value in parameter functions

Make a function that receives a parameter. Increment the value of the parameter in the body of the function.
Outside the function, declare a variable that holds a number. Then pass that variable as a parameter to the function call above.
After the function call has been made, outside the function, console.log the original variable. Has it changed?


4. Demonstrate how reference types are copied by reference in paramter functions
Similar to exercise 3. make a function that receives a parameter. This parameter will in fact be an object with a property called value (that's how this function will be called. So inside the function, increase the value property of the parameter.
Call this function with a variable that holds an object, with the value property.

After the function call, outside the function, console.log the original object. Has it changed?
