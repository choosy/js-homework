Mosh lesson - Property descriptors

https://codewithmosh.com/courses/310571/lectures/4881220


Create an object called course with the following keys: id, price, name, description, author

As you learned with Mosh, properties of objects have attributes, called property attributes. 
It's almost like a property of an object has some tiny properties of its own. WTF???? :)

These attributes determine if the property is: writable, enumerable, configurable (can delete the property??)


With using these  attributes make the course object in such a way that:
- you cannot change the properties: id, price, name
- you cannot delete the properties: id, name
- when you iterate over the properties (keys) of this object, you do not see the id, you only see the rest of them.
