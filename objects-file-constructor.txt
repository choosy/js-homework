Create a constructor function that will be used to create File objects.
The constructor function will have one parameter, called filePath.
Inside the contructor, create and attached to "this" the filePath property that will be equal to the filePath parameter of the constructor.

Then, add the following methods to the File object:
- getSize() -> will return the size of the file
- isFile() -> returns boolean. True if filePath points to a valid file on your filesystem. False if not.
- fileType -> will return a string with the extension. For example "js". Or "txt".
- moveTo(pathName) -> will actually move the file to the path specified by pathName.

Important Note! The file objects here will be created with your constructor function like this

let myfile = new MyFile('/Users/cah/js-training/exercise.js')

Your object will only receive the path to the file, and everything else needs to be obtained using nodejs fs module: https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html


So your constructor function will be MyFile(). The methods, getSize(), isFile(), fileType() and moveTo(), will need to extract the information just based on the path of the file.
