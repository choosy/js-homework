Create a constructor function that will be used to create File objects.
The constructor function will have one parameter, called filePath.
Inside the contructor, create and attached to "this" the filePath property that will be equal to the filePath parameter of the constructor.

Then, add the following methods to the File object:
- getSize() -> will return the size of the file
- isFile() -> returns boolean. True if filePath points to a valid file on your filesystem. False if not.
- fileType -> will return a string with the extension. For example "js". Or "txt".
- moveTo(pathName) -> will actually move the file to the path specified by pathName.
