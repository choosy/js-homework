Mosh class:

Constructor Prototypes
https://codewithmosh.com/courses/310571/lectures/4881223

----

We know that any object that we create has a prototype (we call it also parent) that we can find by using the __proto__ property.
When we create an object using a constructor, the prototype of our object is another object that we call it for simplicity a "base".
So for example if we create a mycircle object from a Circle() constructor, we call mycircle.__proto__ as circleBase (which is not the same as the constructor neither the object we create).

What we need to demonstrate in this exercise is that the constructor of our object, the function Circle, has a property called prototype that is exactly circleBase.


Demonstrate the above information with two kind of objects made from two constructors: Circle() and Person()

Include the information in the Prototype Mindmap.
