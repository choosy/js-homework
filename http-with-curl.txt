Create a curl command for every URL of the launchbase-desafio-foodfy-with-data project.

Make one file in wich you record (you paste) the contents of the request and response like this:

- first line of request and request headers
- response headers
- response body

Similar to how they appear in Firefox's Network TAB.

Use in your shell: man curl
to read more about the curl options. When you use man, you enter in what is called a SHELL PAGER.
A shell pager is a program meant to read inside shell. Example of shell pagers are: less, more.
Commands to navigate in less pager:
q to quit
Ctrl+D to scroll half screen down
Ctrl+U to scroll half screen up
/text to search for text -> press "n" for next occurrence down, press "N" for next occurrence up
