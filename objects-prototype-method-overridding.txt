Create the same constructors, Product, Course, Tshirt from te objects-prototype-calling-the-super-constructor.js

Also use the extend function to define the prototypical inheritance like in the intermediate function inheritance exercise.


Then create another method in the parent (the Product) constructor, method that is called sell().
This should return a string like "The product with the title <use-the-current-object-title> has been sold at price <use-the-current-object-price>"

Then override this method, the sell() method in the Course objects (using the Course.prototype) to change the string slightly.

"The author for the course <course title> needs to be paid his author fee"

Then modify it to return an array of strings. First string needs to come from calling the sell() method from his parent (Product). Second string will be the one above: "The author for the course <course title> needs to be paid his author fee"


This will be the final version of the sell() method for Course.

Use jest to test that the sell() for Product and Course return the right things.

Also, without implementing a sell() in Tshirt, test that when you call tshirt.sell() then the sell() method in the Product.prototype is used.
