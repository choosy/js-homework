Create a project from scratch based on Node and Express that exposes a REST API.

This will be used by programmers and partners around the world that will interact with our platform in a programmatic way.

The REST API's role is here to manage courses. So our entity is a "course".

A course will have the following fields:
- id
- name
- author
- price

When adding courses, normally a REST API backend will communicate with a database to store the courses there. In this exercise, we will NOT use a database, but a json file, as a method of storage.

The REST operations to implement for the course entity will be:
- create a course
- delete a course
- update a course


Test your REST API with:
- a sepparate JS code -> that does not belong to this project
- curl
- insomnia
