Review Mosh lesson "Prototypes and Prototypical inheritance"

Note how Mosh is talking about an object he calls "baseObject".
In some tutorials this is called the root object or the Object object, and is a unique object that is the last parent(prototype) of all objects in JS.

Task:
create two objects with the literal syntax, and console.log their prototype.
Then console log the equality comparison (==) of their prototype.

Who's their prototype? Are they equal?

Use the toString() method on any of your objects. If you did not define the toString() method, why is it working?

After completing the exercise, go line by line (read and then execute and observe console.log) through the exercise objects-prototype-base1.js and think if it makes sense.

Use the Prototypes JS MindMap to support your conclusions: https://whimsical.com/FyZKGj3KRQgsQFvSFMX9ZZ
