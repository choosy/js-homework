Use the Course object from objects-prototype-iterating-own-and-prototype-members.js exercise.

But this time, create also another object, called Product.

Attach the priceToReais() method to the Product.prototype (instead of the Course.prototype).

Then make the courseBase (so Course.prototype) inherit from Product.prototype -> with Object.create
Make sure you "reset the constructor" as Mosh explains in the resetting the constructor lesson.

Using jasmine, test that if you create a course with the price of 10 (default 10 USD), then the course.priceToReais() will return 56.9

Also add a toString method to the Product.prototype, and then using jasmine, test that when you convert a course object to String, you get what is expected.


Create another object, with a constructor called TShirt. The same as with the course, make the tShirtBase (that is TShirt.prototype) to inherit from the Product.prototype -> with Object.create

Also add in your jasmine tests that the tshirt.priceToReais() is the correct one, and also converting tshirt objects to String is the correct one.

Name your spec file in a way so that you can easily connect it with the exercise.
