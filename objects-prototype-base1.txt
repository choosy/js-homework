This exercise has two parts:

1. First part

Create two objects using the object literal syntax.
Each object will represent a course, so call the variable that will store the objects: course1 and course2.
The properties that the objects will have are: title, author and price.

After that, define two more variables, called parent1 and parent2.
parent1 make it to be the prototype (parent) of course1.
parent2 make it to be the prototype (parent) of course2

Then console log parent1,  and console log parent2.
Then console log parent1 === parent2.

This will prove who is parent1, who is parent2 and if they are equals.
Think of the signification of parent1/parent2. Who is it?

Before each console.log(), write another console.log() that shows as a string what you're console logging.

For example:
console.log('parent1 === parent2')
console.log(parent1 === parent2)

2. Second part

Create, in the same file, an object, this time using the constructor syntax, with a constructor called FancyCourse.
This FancyCourse object will have two methods.
toString() -> will return a string with the title property of the current object
convertPrice() -> will use the price attribute of the current object, and convert a USD price to a REAL price and return it


Afterwards, set as a prototype for course1, a new FancyCourse object. and try the toString() and convertPrice() for course1.
Then try (without changing the prototype) the same toString() and convertPrice() for course2.
