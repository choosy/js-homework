Import EventEmitter class and create an object of type EventEmitter.

Name the variable of this object catcher. In English catcher would be someone that catches.
You actually can call the variable as you wish, but calling it catcher will help remembering the fact that you use this object to catch events.

These type of objects are used to:
- emit events
- then to catch the events you emitted (register a listener) and execute a function (the listener handler) when that happens.


Use this object to emit an event called "courseSold" with the arg that represents a course, like id and title: for example {id: 3, title: "Object oriented JS with Mosh"}
Then use the same object to catch this event and console.log the course that has been sold.
