Put the function File made in the exercise object-file-constructor.js in a module and export it.
Then make another file, for example, get-file-info.js that will import the function File that you export it above.

And use it to get informations about a file.

You can export the function File either in the existing file object-file-constructor.js, or make another one, however you choose.
