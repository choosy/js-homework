Create a constructor function that will be used to create person objects.

The person objects need to have: first name, last name, age.

Use the constructor function to validate that the first name has only letters, last name also has only letters, and age is a number between 0 and 160 :)

Also, if first name has space before or after, like '  Cassia ' , then clean that space.

So the constructor needs to receive three paramters, and those parameters will be saved in the objects properties.
