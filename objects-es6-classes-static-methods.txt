Use the objects and prototypes created in the objects-prototype-method-overriding.js exercise

Create just the Product class -> that will make new product objects.

Make sell and toString as instance methods in the class.

However, make priceToReais a static method.
Now, show that this static method does not have access to this (or does it?). Since this method is called on a class and not on an instance object, you do not have a current object to take this.price attribute.
So instead, how you can adapt that this method still works, and calculates the priceToReais but as a static method?
