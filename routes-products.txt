Create a completely new folder and Github repository with an Express application started from scratch.

Here, create routes for:
- creating a product
- showing a product
- editing a product

The actual route functions will not perform any action in a database, and not even nunjucks will be used.
The route functions will just return a debug response to the server, to show what request it received. For example, when creating a product the response will be:

Received a POST request to /products/create with the following body:

name: my product
price: 23
currency: usd


Test all of it with Cypress
