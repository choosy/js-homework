Create the same constructors, Product, Course, Tshirt from the objects-prototype-method-overriding.js

But this time, do not use extend anymore.
Do not use inheritance between Product and Course and neither between Product and Tshirt

Define a mixin called "isProduct" that will have the sell method and the toString method as the ones that are now
attached to the Product.prototype.

Define another mixin called "priceToReais" which will have the priceToReais method.


Then use Object.assign to add these behaviours (mixins) to all Course and Tshirt objects.

Test all of it with jest.
